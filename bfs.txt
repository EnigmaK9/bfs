BFS(graph, start):
    Initialize an empty queue
    Create a set or array to keep track of visited nodes
    Add the start node to the queue and mark it as visited

    while the queue is not empty:
            current_node = dequeue from the front of the queue
            Process or print current_node

            for each neighbor of current_node:
                if neighbor is not visited:
                    Add neighbor to the queue
                    Mark neighbor as visited
